```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# Functions We Need

```{r}
roll_one_die <- function(){
  sample(1:6, size = 1)
}


roll_two_dice <- function(){
  roll_one_die() + roll_one_die()
}

```

You will probably want to put your results in a tibble, since that is what ggplot wants.


```{r}
map_int(1:10, ~ roll_two_dice())
```
